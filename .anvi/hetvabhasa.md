# Hetvābhāsa — Error Patterns

> Empty at project start. Patterns accumulate as bugs are diagnosed and fixed. Every fix that took >1 attempt OR revealed a non-obvious root cause MUST be cataloged here.

## Format

```
### H<N>: <short pattern name>

**Symptom:** what the user sees
**Trap:** the wrong fix (the one that "feels right" but doesn't address root cause)
**Root cause:** the actual mechanism
**Real fix:** what works
**Detection signal:** the early symptom that distinguishes this from look-alikes
**REF:** Ground Truth doc + file:line citations
**Origin:** session/date when first observed
```

## Predicted patterns (forward-looking, from THESIS.md §57)

These are not yet cataloged from real bugs — they are pre-mortem predictions. Promote to formal entries once observed.

- **Pure-flag lying** — node declares `pure: true` but reads `Math.random` or `Date.now`; cache corrupts; bugs look random.
- **Time-as-closure** — node captures time via `useFrame` closure instead of `Time` socket; render-frame-N ≠ viewport-at-time-T.
- **Op bypass** — direct `dagStore.setState` outside dispatcher; undo no-ops, agent control breaks at this node type.
- **Agent tool-call drift** — agent calls tool with valid-looking but wrong-shape params; zod rejects; agent loops trying same call.
- **OPFS quota silent fail** — save returns success but data truncated; reload loses last changes.
- **Capability leak** — code assumes desktop fs and breaks in web build (or vice versa); discovered at production time.
- **Triplex JSX-as-truth leak** — code expects Triplex's scene model; breaks because DAG is the truth, JSX is a view.

## Cataloged patterns

### H1: Vite scaffolder cancels silently on non-empty directory

**Symptom:** `npm create vite@latest .` exits with "└ Operation cancelled" — no error code, no diagnostic; Vite-shaped files never appear.
**Trap:** assume the scaffolder failed because of a missing flag; try `--yes`, `--force`, piped `printf 'y\n'`. None work — the prompt is interactive-only.
**Root cause:** `create-vite` refuses to overwrite a directory that already contains files (THESIS.md / .anvi/ / NEXT_SESSION.md in our case). It has no non-interactive override.
**Real fix:** write the Vite skeleton (package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.{,app,node}.json, index.html, src/main.tsx, src/index.css, src/vite-env.d.ts) by hand. Cheap; gives full control. Avoids the "preserve THESIS.md" race.
**Detection signal:** "Operation cancelled" with no other output, even with `--yes` flag.
**REF:** P0 Wave A (2026-05-05).

### H2: Vite dep-scan walks unrelated subdirectories with index.html

**Symptom:** `npm run dev` fails with `The following dependencies are imported but could not be resolved: dist/bundle.js (imported by /path/to/blockbench/index.html)`.
**Trap:** assume the bundle is a real Basher dep; chase the missing file.
**Root cause:** Vite's `optimizeDeps` scanner crawls every `index.html` in the project root looking for entry points. The GPL `blockbench/` reference checkout has its own `index.html` referencing files that don't exist in our tree.
**Real fix:** scope the scan with `optimizeDeps.entries: ['index.html', 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}']` AND `server.fs.deny: ['blockbench/**']`. The `.gitignore` exclusion is necessary but NOT sufficient — Vite scans the working tree, not just tracked files.
**Detection signal:** dep-resolution errors naming a file in a sibling directory you didn't import.
**REF:** P0 Wave F (2026-05-05); `vite.config.ts`.

### H3: Local port collision with another dev server

**Symptom:** Playwright tests all fail with "Layout testid not found"; the page snapshot shows an entirely different app's UI ("View / Visuals / Samples / Prefs / SonicPi.js").
**Trap:** assume our app's layout broke; debug React rendering, hydration, boot order — none of which is the issue.
**Root cause:** Vite's default port 5173 was already held by another local project. With `strictPort:false` (the default), Vite silently fell through to 5174. Playwright was still pointed at 5173 and got the OTHER project's HTML.
**Real fix:** pin a project-specific port (5180) and set `strictPort: true` so Vite refuses to fall through. Match `playwright.config.ts` baseURL + webServer URL to the same port.
**Detection signal:** test failures whose page-snapshot HTML doesn't look like your project at all.
**REF:** P0 Wave H (2026-05-05); `vite.config.ts:18`.

### H4: TypeScript Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike> rejected by lib.dom BlobPart

**Symptom:** `tsc -b` fails with "Type 'Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>' is not assignable to type 'BlobPart'. Type 'SharedArrayBuffer' is not assignable to type 'ArrayBuffer'."
**Trap:** add `as BlobPart` cast — works but lies about the runtime type.
**Root cause:** Modern TS lib.dom typings constrain Blob/WritableStream inputs to `Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>` specifically (excluding `SharedArrayBuffer`). Generic Uint8Array is widened to `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` which the strict typing rejects.
**Real fix:** copy through a fresh `ArrayBuffer` before constructing the Blob: `const ab = new ArrayBuffer(bytes.byteLength); new Uint8Array(ab).set(bytes); writable.write(new Blob([ab]));`. Costs one allocation; produces a value the strict typing accepts.
**Detection signal:** `BlobPart` / `WritableStream` write rejections specifically mentioning `SharedArrayBuffer`.
**REF:** P0 Wave C (2026-05-05); `src/core/storage/OpfsStorage.ts:52`.

### H5: zod `.default()` widens input type beyond `z.ZodType<P>`

**Symptom:** `paramSchema: z.object({ foo: z.number().default(1) })` fails to satisfy `paramSchema: z.ZodType<P>` because the schema's input allows `undefined` (which gets defaulted) while the output P does not.
**Trap:** make P include `| undefined` everywhere — propagates noise through the entire codebase.
**Root cause:** `z.ZodType<P>` defaults to `z.ZodType<P, ZodTypeDef, P>` (input == output). `.default()` makes input wider than output.
**Real fix:** widen the contract: `paramSchema: z.ZodType<P, z.ZodTypeDef, unknown>`. The boundary parses unknown bytes (the JSON we loaded, the agent's tool args) into a defaulted `P`. Internal code reads the strict P; external bytes are validated and filled at the seam.
**Detection signal:** `_input.foo` types are `T | undefined` but the schema's output type doesn't include undefined.
**REF:** P0 Wave D (2026-05-05); `src/core/dag/types.ts:65`.

### H6: Pixel-diff baseline corrupted by overlay text that updates every frame

**Symptom:** Reference screenshot for PostFx beauty fails on second run with high pixel-diff ratio even though the cube renders identically.
**Trap:** loosen `maxDiffPixelRatio` until tests pass — masks a real regression-detection signal.
**Root cause:** the FpsMeter overlay shows live frame stats inside the same DOM node we screenshot; its text changes every 500ms, so the diff is dominated by font-anti-alias differences in a 5px region.
**Real fix:** Playwright's `mask: [page.getByTestId('fps-meter')]` blacks out the overlay region during diff comparison. Keep the strict 2% threshold for the rendered geometry.
**Detection signal:** screenshot diff hot-spots concentrated in a small text region; rendered geometry pixels match.
**REF:** P0 Wave H (2026-05-05); `tests/e2e/acceptance.spec.ts:171`.

### H7: Uncontrolled `defaultValue` inputs silently desync from the store

**Symptom:** Inspector input field continues to show the pre-undo value after Cmd+Z (or any external param mutation — agent op, project reload). Acceptance test #5 still passes because it only writes through the input, never reads.
**Trap:** assume "the test passes so the binding is fine"; ship and discover the divergence the moment undo gets a UI binding.
**Root cause:** `<input defaultValue={value} onChange={...} />` is uncontrolled — React sets the DOM value once on mount. Subsequent renders DO NOT propagate `value` changes to the DOM. The store updates, the visible input doesn't.
**Real fix:** controlled inputs everywhere — `value={value}` keyed off a `useDagStore` selector, `onChange` dispatches `setParam`. Costs zero perf in zustand (selector-driven re-render only when the param changes).
**Detection signal:** input field value matches initial render but not subsequent store mutations from non-input sources. Use a focused regression test that mutates state from outside the input and asserts the input updates.
**REF:** P0 self-review (2026-05-05); `src/app/Inspector.tsx:21`; regression test `tests/e2e/acceptance.spec.ts` #10.

### H8: Playwright pixel-diff snapshots are platform-suffixed by default

**Symptom:** Local CI run on macOS green; GitHub Actions Ubuntu runner fails test #7 with `A snapshot doesn't exist at .../postfx-beauty-chromium-linux.png, writing actual.`
**Trap:** lower the threshold or skip the test in CI — both violate honesty contract.
**Root cause:** Playwright suffixes snapshot filenames by `${browser}-${platform}` to honor real GPU rasterization differences. A snapshot committed only as `chromium-darwin.png` does not match a Linux runner. This is a feature, not a bug.
**Real fix:** commit a Linux baseline alongside the macOS one. Generate it by (a) running Playwright in the official Docker image locally, OR (b) downloading the failed CI run's artifact (Playwright attaches the actual rendered PNG) and committing that as the baseline. Both baselines live in `tests/e2e/acceptance.spec.ts-snapshots/`.
**Detection signal:** "snapshot doesn't exist" error naming a path with a different platform suffix than what's committed.
**REF:** P0 CI fix (2026-05-05); `tests/e2e/acceptance.spec.ts-snapshots/postfx-beauty-chromium-{darwin,linux}.png`.
